This heatmap shows the differences in bike usage between subscribers to a bike rental subscription and regular paying customers, or those who pay by trip. This map goes one step further by also categorizing the data by day of the week and gender.


## Summary 

This data analysis provides insightful information for investors into the demand for bike renting businesses in New York which can be implemented in cities like Des Moines. It's clear there is a high demand for bikes, regardless of gender and it appears to be a popular method of transportation and leisure.

Another useful analysis of this data could be to see which hours bikes were used the least, to plan out the most ideal time slots for maintenance of the bikes and adjust the price for a lower demand.

Another analysis might be to take into consideration the average distance of rides by users, in order to more efficiently plan the locations of different bike stations.
